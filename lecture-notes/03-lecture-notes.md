# BANKING SYSTEMS AND BANKING CRISES, 1800-1913

The object of this lecture is to offer a partial survey of banking systems and banking crises in the 19th century. It is coupled, and accompanies, a classic reading (Gerschenkron) which focuses more on the consequences of bank-led development rather than banking systems per se.
