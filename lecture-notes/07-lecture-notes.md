# Inequality and its financial and economic consequences

The topic of todays lecture is inequality. Unlike, however, what you may have previously studied about inequality the focus of this week is less about the *origins* of inequality, nor is it about trying to document the timing/extent of inequality, something you probably encountered before studying Pickety and related work. Rather, it is about what the *consequences* of late 20th century inequality are: their consequences for how the economy works, how financial markets work, and the role of inequality in explaining observable economic patterns.

One key idea that we will return to several times in this lecture, and that is the focus of at least one of this week's readings [@bartscher2020] is that inequality and debt have gone together: rising inequality has been matched by rising indebtedness by households in the west --- in this instance really in the US. The incorporation of debt gives me a little leeway to work backwords to sketch out a few ideas we would have covered with last week's readings about the emerging market crises, and then to tie that forwards into some reflections on the emerging sanctions regime in relation to the Russian-Ukrainian war. This is a little tangential but I am choosing to draw the connection so that we can think a little about inequality in the context of global developmental strategies, the weight of history in determining those strategies, and present events.

## Studying inequality

The rise of studying inequality -- really credited to Piketty although points should go to others too like Tony Atkinson etc.

## Stylized Facts on Inequality

Emphasize the difficulties here and yet nevertheless the broad picture is likely to be accurate.

Note that the broad picture doesn't tell us much about the *causes*: Piketty's sketch of a mechanism with differential returns to $K$ and $L$ of the form $r > g$ is possible but wouldn't match very well with e.g. the article you started this course with about the long-run secular decline in the rate of interest [@schmelzing2020]. Other accounts tend more towards rooting the rise of inequality in domestic political economy and rent-seeking, or in theories of winner-take-all markets, technology etc. Probably a bit of everything.
