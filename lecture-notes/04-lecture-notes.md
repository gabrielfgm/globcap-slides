# Notes on Monetary Policy, Capital Flows and the Gold Standard 1870-1930

The @obstfeld2005 piece opens with the clever line that the 'golden straightjacket' of globalization on economic policy-making needs to be assessed *both* for how golden it is *and* for how straight it is.

In theory, globalization imposes the trilemma onto macroeconomic policy-making. Out of the desirable goals of

1.  Stable exchange rates
2.  free capital mobility
3.  and flexible domestic monetary policy,

you can only pick two. The logic of this constraint is straightforward to reason about: if country A & B's currencies trade at a fixed rate, and if private actors are free to buy/sell securities denominated in those currencies, than if A tries to lower interest rates to promote domestic growth speculators will move capital out of A and into B arbitraging the interest rate differential. Faced with this outflow of capital policy-makers in A will need to decide between giving up on their interest rate decision, abandoning the fixed exchange rate and allowing the currency of A to fall relative to B, or barring private actors from moving their money out of A.

At different points in history, the international monetary system has tended more to one or another position in the trilemma. For instance, we currently live in an era wherein many states have opted for a free-hand in conducting monetary policy (3), and permit the free movement of capital (2), but accept that their exchange rates will fluctuate. Conversely, we might think of the Euro as european countries sacrificing independent monetary policies (3) in order to get fixed exchange rates alongside free capital mobility.

While the trilemma is very clear in theory it is a little more ambiguous to document in practice. For one thing, the terms of the trilemma can be a little bit fuzzy: capital movements can be allowed but discouraged or taxed, arbitrage costs might offer some, or a lot, of wiggle room on domestic policy management, exchange rates might be 'fixed' within a band as was common for European countries during Bretton-Woods.

A related issue is the difficulty of measuring how tightly these constraints bind. Exchange rates that are *de jure* fixed might be *de facto* floating, capital mobility is difficult to measure, and what 'a flexible domestic monetary policy' means is particularly opaque.

One operationalization of these concepts would be to track the short-term nominal interest rate as a metric capturing the degree of domestic policy autonomy. This is the approach pursued by @obstfeld2005 who set out to study how different exchange rate regimes influence the divergence of short-term rates from a global benchmark.
