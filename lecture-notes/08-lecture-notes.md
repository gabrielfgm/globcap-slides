# The Eurozone crisis

The object of these lectures is to examine the 2008 crisis -- now often called the Great Recession -- from the perspective of the eurozone. In particular, I want us to focus on

1.  What is distinct about the crisis trajectory in the eurozone, and
2.  To what extent the eurozone itself -- the euro and associated institutions -- is to blame for the dynamics we saw in Europe after 2008.

To fix intuitions it is helpful to begin by seeing where the crisis hurt the most.

(Show euro vs select non-euro growth rates post crisis).

Outline:

-   Origins of the crisis

    -   Optimal currency area and integration

    -   The problems of persistent current account imbalances and money/credit growth in north vs south

    -   Sovereign mis-pricing? Assumption of a bail-out?

-   Crisis dynamics

    -   Doom-loops and bank-sovereign interactions

    -   Problems of coordinated banking supervision

    -   Problems of unco-ordinated monetary policy
