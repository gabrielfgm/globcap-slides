## Situating this topic

+ Moving into a period of more data-rich economic history
  - Data availability has drawn more cliometricians 
  - More interest in *testing economic theory* in addition to *explaining what happened*
  
+ Integration, connections, arbitrage
  - We are focusing today in particular on integration and connections between London and Amsterdam
  - Foreshadows many 19th and 20th c. topics

## What do we learn about integration?

## What does the period tell us about financial markets?

+ Think of this as some of the framing for Koudijs

## Boats and decomposing return variance

## What about when a boat doesn't arrive?

+ Give categories

---

## Reflections on learning from Koudijs

+ What is the question of *external validity*?
+ Does it tell us things about how *efficient* the AMS market was (Neal's goal)?

---

## Some broad thoughts on testing market efficiency in the past

+ What is the alternative model?
